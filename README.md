# ImageSegmentation
Part of a company project. The purpose of this task was to create a prototype application which would utilize machine learning to detect defects in metal sheets.


Disclaimer. This program uses relatively big pickle-file as its dataset, and sadly GitHub doesn't like those.
To get this application up and running you need the following dependencies:
- numpy 
- tkinter
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- Pillow

These dependencies can be instaled with 

``` pip install . ```

But if the command doesn't work you can install them separately like this

``` pip install <name of the dependecy> ```

After dependecies are installed you can run the application with the following command:

``` python ImageSegmentation.py ```

and this window should pop up.
